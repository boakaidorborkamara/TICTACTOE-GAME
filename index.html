                        The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
                    </li>
                </ul>
